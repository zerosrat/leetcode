Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:

![](160.png)

begin to intersect at node c1.

Notes:

- If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
- The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
- You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
- Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.
